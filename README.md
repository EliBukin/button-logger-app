Button Logger App

The Button Logger App is a Flask web application with a straightforward purpose:

    Button Push Logging:
        Every button push on the webpage is logged into an 'app-log' file with a timestamp.
        The last 6 entries are displayed on the webpage for quick reference.

    Error Management:
        If a false positive or double push is logged, you can easily delete it.
        Deletions are recorded in a separate 'deleted-entries-log' file, ensuring a clear record of all changes.

With the Button Logger App, you can efficiently monitor and manage button presses, maintaining accurate logs with ease.
